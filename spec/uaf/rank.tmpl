Which of these validated use-after-free findings is most worth investigating deeper?

Consider the following factors when ranking:
- Likelihood/confidence of being a true positive (not a false positive)
- Exploitability (how easy would it be for an attacker to trigger this)
- Impact if successfully exploited (memory corruption, code execution, DoS, etc.)
- Attack complexity and prerequisites needed
- Whether the vulnerability is in a critical code path

Rank these findings from most critical to least critical based on which ones deserve immediate security attention.
